
Exercise 3: Inventory Management System

Topics Covered: Go Conditions, Go Type Casting, Go Functions, Go Arrays, Go Strings, Go Errors

Case Study:

A store needs to manage its inventory of products. Build an application that includes the following:

1. Product Struct: Create a struct to represent a product with fields for ID, name, price (float64), and stock (int).

2. Add Product: Write a function to add new products to the inventory. Use type casting to ensure price inputs are converted to float64.

3. Update Stock: Implement a function to update the stock of a product. Use conditions to validate the input (e.g., stock cannot be negative).

4. Search Product: Allow users to search for products by name or ID. If a product is not found, return a custom error message.

5. Display Inventory: Use loops to display all available products in a formatted table.

Bonus:

â€¢ Add sorting functionality to display products by price or stock in ascending order.
