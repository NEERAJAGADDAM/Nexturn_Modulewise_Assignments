Exercise 5: Climate Data Analysis

Topics Covered: Go Arrays, Go Strings, Go Type Casting, Go Functions, Go Conditions, Go Loops

Case Study:

You are tasked with analyzing climate data from multiple cities. The data includes the city name, average temperature (°C), and rainfall (mm).

1. Data Input: Create a slice of structs to store data for each city. Input data can be hardcoded or taken from the user.

2. Highest and Lowest Temperature: Write functions to find the city with the highest and lowest average temperatures. Use conditions for comparison.

3. Average Rainfall: Calculate the average rainfall across all cities using loops. Use type casting if necessary.

4. Filter Cities by Rainfall: Use loops to display cities with rainfall above a certain threshold. Prompt the user to enter the threshold value.

5. Search by City Name: Allow users to search for a city by name and display its data.

Bonus:

• Add error handling for invalid city names and invalid input for thresholds.
